# mod4_project
We obtained data from the U.S. Census website, as well as Kaggle to test a few chosen variables against the amount of hate crimes in each U.S. state. Hate crimes have been apparently increasing over the years, with many attributing the presidential election and hate speech to the increase. We decided to test other factors such as poverty rates, income inequality (Gini coefficient), median household income, as well as the voter percentage for each state.

To increase the accuracy in our results, we pulled data from 2013 - 2018 for all variables besides voter percentage (as voter percentage was a stagnant variable). We initially tested the Pearson coefficient among all our dependent variables in order to minimize multicollinearity. We also tested the normality of the independent variable, hate crimes per state, using the QQ plot.
